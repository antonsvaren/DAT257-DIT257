What do I want to learn or understand better?

I want to keep learning how to make design more understandable.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

I can help by being available when my team members have trouble with figma link or trying prototypes.  

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

I participate in sprint planning, sprint retrospective and 
doing reviews for definition of done and also social contract. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

I have created different alternatives for logotype,
so that PO and stakeholder decide which one we gonna use for the app.
I have also extended the climate page so that it is more structured and
provides detailed information on each climate change topic.
