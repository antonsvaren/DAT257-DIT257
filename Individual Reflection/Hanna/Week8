What do I want to learn or understand better?
There are a few things we would like to improve UI for the app, so I would like to continue to learn more about creating layouts. 

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
At this stage I don’t think that I can help the team with learning something new, however I can help with the final report. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I participated in sprint planning, sprint retrospective and worked together with my team members to complete the tasks which are left in the project. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I did some changes on  the overview page, climate page and made a video-demo of the app.
