what do I want to learn or understand better?

Based on feedback from the sprint review, 
I want to learn how to make design more understandable
and fulfill user's needs as well as PO and stakeholders needs. 

As my team decided to work with Kotlin which I have not  worked with before.
I also would like to learn this language, so that I can get a basic understanding
about this and might contribute in the later sprint when the need comes. 

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

I made a workflow diagram for the app,
in order to help my team members when they try the prototype.

what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

I participate in planning the sprint, reviewing the result of the print
and do sprint retrospective.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

This week I did a second UI iteration.
