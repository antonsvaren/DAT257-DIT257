what do I want to learn or understand better?

I want to learn how to make a usable, equitable, enjoyable and useful weather app for users. 
In addition I want to understand the team's needs and their pain points when testing the µWeather prototypes.
I also want to get familiar with Android Studio which the team is gonna use.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I wrote a small instruction on how to access and test a prototype in Figma. 

what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I participate in planning the first sprint, estimate user stories, review the result of the print and sprint retrospective. 

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This week I created the µWeather app prototype, installed Android Studio.
