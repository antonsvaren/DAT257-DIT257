What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to get more familiar with Agile workflow.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can help out by being available when someone needs to clarify information that I know. 
 
What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Doing card reviews backlog, so that everyone knows that these cards are good to go or need to change before moving them to done.
Doing tasks on deadline, so that the others have materials that they need for their work. 
 
What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Me and my team decided how we split up tasks. I did a part of the business model canvas and mockup.
