What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to keep learning how to make design more understandable and also create better xml layout in Android Studio. 

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can help my team members who are trying to get the design information (color codes, font size, font style, ...) in figma and understand how it works.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I participated in sprint planning, sprint retrospective and also reviewed the work of others. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I redesigned the climate page with simple vectors, since the images I used in the prototype didn’t work when uploading into android studio.
Elias and I have created xml layouts for the climate page.
