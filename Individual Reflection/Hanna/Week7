What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to keep learning how to create better xml layouts in Android Studio. 

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Like the previous reflection I can help my team members get the design information (color codes, font size, font style, ...) in figma and understand how it works.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I participated in sprint planning, sprint retrospective and worked together with my team members to complete the tasks which are left in the project. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
We worked on the climate page and overview page, I focused on creating xml layouts.
