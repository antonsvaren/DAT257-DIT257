what do I want to learn or understand better?
What the group will work with and what is expected of me.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
At this stage I am not sure, hopefully can teach some programming.

what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Again, not sure at this stage, hope I can be a valuable asset in many areas.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This weeks delivery was the social contract which we all decided on together.
