what do I want to learn or understand better?
	I want to:
	* get a diploma indicating some experience with Agile work flow for job interviews
	* extend my theoretical knowledge of Scrum and related Agile workflows
	* discuss theoretically pros and cons practically and theroertically with different paths
	* practically experiment with and develop my PO and Scrummaster skills

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
	* hopefully with my practical experience from 20+ years in the industry in various roles related to development. 
	Having seen both good and bad examples of Waterfall, Scrum, KIVP, Anarchy, ...
	* focus on a long term perspective (in this case long term is 2 months, where I personally prefer the Kamprad definition of long term (100 years))
	* Hopefully challenge ideas forcing thought through architectural choices
	
what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
	* experience
	* depends on how we choose to use Scrum
	
what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
	* experience, balance between KIS, maintainability and extendibility
	* testing
	* documentation
	* "customer"/usability focus.
	* simple development.
