Customer Value and Scope
your user stories in terms of using a standard pattern, acceptance criteria, task breakdown and effort estimation and 
how this influenced the way you worked and created value

- Task breakdown and estimation a bit better this sprint since we finished more than we did last sprint.

Social Contract and Effort
your social contract, i.e., the rules that define how you work together as a team, how it influenced your work, and how it evolved during the project 
(this means, of course, you should create one in the first week and continuously update it when the need arrives)

- Had some changes/improvements to the social contract this week since we felt it wasn't complete. Added decisions on how to behave in meetings, 
  everyone accepted the changes.

the time you have spent on the course and how it relates to what you delivered (so keep track of your hours so you can describe the current situation)

- Had same meeting time as last sprint but was easier to spend more time alone since we were more comfortable with the software, 
  which led to finishing more tasks.

Design decisions and product structure
which technical documentation you use and why (e.g. use cases, interaction diagrams, class diagrams, domain models or component diagrams, text documents)

- No technical documentation.

Application of Scrum
the sprint review and how it relates to your scope and customer value (Did you have a PO, if yes, who?, if no, 
how did you carry out the review? Did the review result in a re-prioritisation of user stories? 
How did the reviews relate to your DoD? Did the feedback change your way of working?)

- Progress was shown to the PO who gave feedback. The feedback was then dicussed with the team and decisions were made on what to focus on.
