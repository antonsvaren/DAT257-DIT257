Customer Value and Scope
the chosen scope of the application under development including the priority of features and for whom you are creating value

- Features that bring value to the customer are prioritized. Essential features are more important than extras.

your user stories in terms of using a standard pattern, acceptance criteria, task breakdown and effort estimation and 
how this influenced the way you worked and created value

- User stories were written clearly with acceptance criterias, good task breakdown with small tasks.

your acceptance tests, such as how they were performed, with whom, and which value they provided for you and the other stakeholders

- Reviewing each others code, brings value to the person reviewing by giving them insight into more parts of code.

the three KPIs you use for monitoring your progress and how you use them to improve your process

- We needed to improve our estimation and planning looking at KPIs. Our methods for improving were unsuccessful.

Social Contract and Effort
the time you have spent on the course and how it relates to what you delivered (so keep track of your hours so you can describe the current situation)

- If we spent more time helping each other we could have finished more tasks.

Design decisions and product structure
which technical documentation you use and why (e.g. use cases, interaction diagrams, class diagrams, domain models or component diagrams, text documents)

- Figma is used to document design decisions.

how you use and update your documentation throughout the sprints

- Feedback from PO has been used to update figma prototype.

how you ensure code quality and enforce coding standards

- Reviewing pull requests.

Application of Scrum
the roles you have used within the team and their impact on your work

- Stakeholder/PO: Feedback has been considered and impacted our prioritization.

the agile practices you have used and their impact on your work

- Sprint planning has made us divide work, retrospective and review has given us areas improve in,
  several small meetings each week to see if someone needs help.

the sprint review and how it relates to your scope and customer value (Did you have a PO, if yes, who?, if no, 
how did you carry out the review? Did the review result in a re-prioritisation of user stories? 
How did the reviews relate to your DoD? Did the feedback change your way of working?)

- Yes we have a PO. Prioritized working on the UI more to give more customer value.
