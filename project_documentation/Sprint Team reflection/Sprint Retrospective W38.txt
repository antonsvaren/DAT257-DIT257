What has worked?
Sprint planning and splitting into tasks 
starting to use reviews and branches

Where have we had problems?
Spent too little time on the project. There has been reviews, but no follow up on the comments.
While grooming there were some tasks that depended on each other which we didnâ€™t take into account while estimating.
    
What should we continue doing?
Branches and reviewing
        
What should we improve?
Better grooming of the product backlog, moving stuff from ideas to Product backlog describing them and prioritizing them.
More work, more communication
        
What should we stop doing
Wait for someone else to take initative.
Good estimation should make it not necessary to add stories during sprint.
