Customer Value and Scope
the chosen scope of the application under development including the priority of features and for whom you are creating value
- We haven't changed anything sense last sprint.

the success criteria for the team in terms of what you want to achieve within the project 
(this can include the application, but also your learning outcomes, your teamwork, or your effort)

- We haven't changed anything sense last sprint.

your user stories in terms of using a standard pattern, acceptance criteria, task breakdown and effort estimation and 
how this influenced the way you worked and created value

- They user stories hasn't changed, the estimation has atleast as good as last week. We learned from last sprint that we
- had a higher percentage of finished stories, so we decided to work more together and fine tune the application for the 
- oral report. 

your acceptance tests, such as how they were performed, with whom, and which value they provided for you and the other stakeholders

- Reviewing each others code, brings value to the person reviewing by giving them insight into more parts of code.(Same as week 41)

the three KPIs you use for monitoring your progress and how you use them to improve your process

- We worked more together to increase the number of stories and tasks finished. 
- We used the costumer satisfaction in order to figure out what to improve.

Social Contract and Effort
your social contract, i.e., the rules that define how you work together as a team, how it influenced your work, and how it evolved during the project 
(this means, of course, you should create one in the first week and continuously update it when the need arrives)

- We updated it with "If we're not able to participate for more than two weeks because of unlegitimate reason, the team can see it as the person is 
    dropping out of the project", as one member of our group wasn't participating and he later dropped out. 

the time you have spent on the course and how it relates to what you delivered (so keep track of your hours so you can describe the current situation)

- We put more time into the presentation and less into the actual project. But over all we spent pretty much the same amount of time on the course 
  this sprint as the last one. 

Design decisions and product structure
how your design decisions (e.g., choice of APIs, architecture patterns, behaviour) support customer value

- This hasn't changed compared to last sprint. 

which technical documentation you use and why (e.g. use cases, interaction diagrams, class diagrams, domain models or component diagrams, text documents)

- Figma is used to document design decisions.

how you use and update your documentation throughout the sprints

- We have updated our texts for the UI in our application

how you ensure code quality and enforce coding standards

- Reviewing pull requests
- Comments on developed code.
(Same as week 41)

Application of Scrum
the roles you have used within the team and their impact on your work

- Stakeholder/PO: Feedback has been considered and impacted our prioritization.(Same as week 41)

the agile practices you have used and their impact on your work

- Sprint planning has made us divide work, retrospective and review has given us areas improve in. Planning poker to evaluate storie points. 

the sprint review and how it relates to your scope and customer value (Did you have a PO, if yes, who?, if no, 
how did you carry out the review? Did the review result in a re-prioritisation of user stories? 
How did the reviews relate to your DoD? Did the feedback change your way of working?)

- Yes we have a PO. Prioritized working on the UI more to give more customer value. (Same as week 41)

best practices for learning and using new tools and technologies (IDEs, version control, scrum boards etc.; 
do not only describe which tools you used but focus on how you developed the expertise to use them)

-Hasn't changed
