Customer Value and Scope
the chosen scope of the application under development including the priority of features and for whom you are creating value

- Create value for the team by learning and teaching about chosen technology. Get a basic app that uses an API up and running.

the success criteria for the team in terms of what you want to achieve within the project 
(this can include the application, but also your learning outcomes, your teamwork, or your effort)

- Want to make an app gives weather predictions from several weather services. Want to learn about scrum and working agile.

your user stories in terms of using a standard pattern, acceptance criteria, task breakdown and effort estimation 
and how this influenced the way you worked and created value

- First user stories were not written correctly, no acceptance criteria, little to no value for the customer, 
estimations were incorrect and blocked tasks which led to trouble finding work for everyone.

the three KPIs you use for monitoring your progress and how you use them to improve your process

- No KPIs used.

Social Contract and Effort
your social contract, i.e., the rules that define how you work together as a team, how it influenced your work, and how it evolved during the project 
(this means, of course, you should create one in the first week and continuously update it when the need arrives)

- First iteration of social contract was written but has not been necessary to refer to yet.

the time you have spent on the course and how it relates to what you delivered (so keep track of your hours so you can describe the current situation)

We have spent 3 hours together on Sprint Review, Retrospective and Planning. Additionally we have had 1-2 hours of scrum meetings. 
On top of that, individual hours. Did not complete all stories partly because of too little time spent.

Design decisions and product structure
how your design decisions (e.g., choice of APIs, architecture patterns, behaviour) support customer value

- Using a trusted API brings value to customer. Not much customer value yet.

Application of Scrum
the roles you have used within the team and their impact on your work

- Have a PO and Scrum master that are responsible for arranging meetings and writing user stories.

the agile practices you have used and their impact on your work

- Have several meetings each sprint so that everyone knows what to do.

the sprint review and how it relates to your scope and customer value (Did you have a PO, if yes, who?, if no, how did you carry out the review? 
Did the review result in a re-prioritisation of user stories? How did the reviews relate to your DoD? Did the feedback change your way of working?)

- Did not have much to show the PO this week. Do not have a DoD yet.

best practices for learning and using new tools and technologies (IDEs, version control, scrum boards etc.; 
do not only describe which tools you used but focus on how you developed the expertise to use them)

- Researched the best tools to use and helped each other install them. Have an online scrum board that we go through together during sprint planning.
