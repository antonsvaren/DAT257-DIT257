Definition of Done:

a User Story (US) is considered Done when all of the following are fullfilled:
* The assigned reviewer(s) has checked that all the Acceptance Criterias are fullfilled, if there are any Acceptance Criterias
* All the tasks related to the US are Done
* The reviewer(s) has tested the US functionality in Android studio and not noticed any errors
* if the US functionality as a whole was branched out, the Pull Request process has been completed 

Currently we have no coding guidelines that guide the reviewer on what to react on,
Currently we have no requirements on level of unit test, regression tests or manual tests. only requirement on testing is that Aceptance Criteras shall be fullfilled and the US should be resolved.



Pull Request process:
When functionality is beeing beeing developed in a separate branch the branch shall be rebased, if main has evolved, and merged.
before that merge the code should be reviewed by at least one reviewer. 
comments shall be added by the reviewer, the developer will respond through code modifications and/or argumentation until the commenting Reviewer has resolved the conversation.
When all conversations have been resolved the Reviewer will approve the Pull request and merge the branch to main.
The reviewer should look for
* errors in  the code
* lack of requested functionality
* relevant corner cases to test
* readability of the code
* proper commenting
